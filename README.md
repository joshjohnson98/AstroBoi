*You are the AstroBoi and trapped in an orbit after your spaceship was destroyed.*


### Game Concept
The base idea for the game took inspiration from the movie "Gravity" where the astronauts get trapped in the orbit where space debris would pummel them at every revolution. In AstroBoi the behemoth-like shrapnel inching towards the player from beneath provides a sense of urgency.

*Use your jetpack thrusters to evade the lethal shrapnel hurtling towards you.*


### Gameplay Mechanics
The player starts out with limited fuel and oxygen in the beginning, and must collect randomly spawned pickups spread throught the level to replenish their supplies. In addition, there are rotating asteroids that sprout jet plumes which can be used to get a boost in the direction faced by the player. Scoring is based on the length of time survived.

*Space is unforgiving. You must collect jetfuel and oxygen tanks to stay alive. Geysers from stray asteroids can give you a boost.*


### Game Design
The team used Unity engine to design the game with scripts coded in C# for all gameplay components and UI, while the art was created on Adobe Photoshop.
